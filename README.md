## About

### Purpose

This is a continuation of the ARGO UX Master Component Library project.

The ARGO UX Master Component Library is a collection of React components that are used to build the ARGO UX. The library is a proof of concept built to solve ARGO's issues of scalability, design standardization, and reusability. The goal is to have a centrally managed design system which permits updates to be made across all projects from a single codebase.

### Information

The library is built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a tool for developing UI components in isolation.

The library is deployed using [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/), a visual regression testing and review tool for Storybook.

The library is distributed using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), a package manager for JavaScript.

The library is automatically built and deployed using [Semantic-Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), an automated version management and package publishing tool that automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing the package.
